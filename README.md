# Here are some tips about classify files
1. For Java codes
src/com/[packageName]/.java
This folder is for saving java source code.
e.g. Now we have a food feedback system
Then, we should create a package for this feature like
src/com/foodFeedback/menu.java
src/com/foodFeedback/comment.java
...

2. For web page
web/[featureName]/.jsp
web/[featureName]/css/.css
web/[featureName]/img/{.jpg/.png/.gif}
This folder is for saving anything about front-end web pages
e.g. Now we have user login, register,etc.. We call this fetuare is about "user"
so we have
web/user/login.jsp
web/user/css/bootstrap.css
web/user/register.jsp
...

3. Please save all web page in .jsp type
When you finish your html page, just modify the suffix name from .html to .jsp
.jsp file is better for our server-side work
